BMB was not a games company; Sopwith was developed as a demo application for
the Imaginet networking system, an early form of
[LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) that networked IBM
PCs and Atari STs. David Clark has described Sopwith as something he hoped
would attract attention at trade shows.
A more serious application for Imaginet was an electronic mail system system
called NetMail, which was later the subject of the lawsuit mentioned above.

The Imaginet system does not appear to have been particuarly successful and
not much information seems to be available on it.  One
[article](imaginet.md) about the system explains that it allowed multiple
computers to share a floppy disk drive to exchange data, with the drives
possibly being entirely virtual. From examination of the source code, Sopwith
itself appears to have worked by having different players continually reading
and writing from the same disk sector.

On the client computers the drive would appear as though it was just another
floppy drive. This was the origin of the Imaginet name, the idea being that
"you have to imagine that a network's really there". Marketing materials for
Imaginet emphasized this "transparency" that allowed normal DOS software to
interface with the network; this was probably a very important feature in the
years before 1987 when MS-DOS 3.0 introduced native interfaces for networking.

BMB had previously developed a very similar network system to Imaginet for the
Commodore PET called MUPET which had enjoyed some moderate success. As with
Imaginet it allowed multiple computers to share a floppy drive. Much more is
known about this system which may give some sense of how Imaginet worked:
