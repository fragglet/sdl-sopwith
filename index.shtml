This is a port of the classic computer game "Sopwith" to run on modern
computers and operating systems. It is named "SDL Sopwith" as it was
originally based only on the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">LibSDL</a>
graphics library. There is now also a port to <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">
Gtk+</a>, the widget library used by <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>.
While the game reamins much the same as it did twenty years ago, small changes
and optional features have been added to give the player more flexibility
and challenges.

This is based on the original sopwith code, which is
