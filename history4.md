# The Internet

With the advent of the Internet, people inevitably started talking about
Sopwith. Newsgroup [alt.games.sopwith](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.games.sopwith)
began in 1995 and provided a convenient place for discussion for the next
five years until newsgroups fell out of use. For a time, there was also a
forum hosted on eGroups (later Yahoo! Groups), the content of which have
sadly now been lost.

Fan site [sopwith.org](http://www.sopwith.org/) appeared around 2000,
providing by far the most detailed information about the game that was
known at the time. The site shared the various different versions along with
mods and tools such as unofficial level editors. The site is still online to
this day, although it has been mostly dormant in recent years.

# The source code release

In 2000, Sopwith fan Andrew Jenner made contact with David L. Clark, after
discovering his website identifying himself as the original author of the game.
Andrew had already been performing his own reverse engineering project,
decompiling the original Sopwith binaries to C source code. He was subsequently
able to convince David to release the source code to the game.

This first release was of the *The Network Edition* that contained some of
David's further enhancements to the game that fans had not previously seen. It
also included Andrew's reverse engineered versions of Sopwith 1 and 2. This
first release was under a
non-[free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) license, but a
second release was later made of the *Author's Edition* source code under the
GNU GPL (there are very few differences between the Network and Author's
Editions).

This source code release was followed by [Sopwith
3](https://sopwith3.sourceforge.net/), a sequel/remake by Andrew Jenner and
Jornand de Buisonje based on the original source code that is described as
"semi-official".

# Ports

The first release of SDL Sopwith was made in October 2001, adapting the
Sopwith source code to use the [LibSDL](https://libsdl.org/) cross-platform
library. A package was added to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) in 2003
and the port has since made its way into many other Linux distros along with
the FreeBSD ports collection.

SDL Sopwith has since served as the basis for a number of ports to different
platforms (a list can be found on the [links page](links.md)).

# Remakes and Cultural Impact

Sopwith has inspired many other games, although exactly how many is unclear,
since the concept of a sidescrolling airplane shoot-'em up has no doubt been
independently invented by others. The following are a few examples, though
there is a more comprehensive list on the [links](links.md) page.

![Sopwith VR screenshot](img/sopwith-vr.jpg)

[Sopwith VR (2018)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/998660/Sopwith_VR/), a
VR game that explicitly lists the original Sopwith as an inspiration.

[Goplanes](https://archive.kontek.net/sopwith.classicgaming.gamespy.com/goplanes.htm),
another game that lists Sopwith as an influence.

places.
