* [sopwith.org](http://www.sopwith.org/), a fan site with lots of details
  about the original game.
* [alt.games.sopwith](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.games.sopwith) - a (sadly)
  long-inactive newsgroup about Sopwith, although you can find some
  interesting discussions from the '90s if you're willing to dig through the
  spam...
* [The old Sopwith forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20020620233656/http://pub50.ezboard.com/fsopwithfrm1)
  from sopwith.org, now long dead and archived...
* [Sopwith on Mobygames](https://www.mobygames.com/game/1380/sopwith/).
* ["Wild Blue Yonder"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_U.S._Air_Force_%28song%29)
  aka "The U.S. Air Force", the song played on the Sopwith title screen and in
  the game.
* [Sopwith Youtube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHt4bcu83-6QJexQ8pYlS42jEkmA3C7RW):
  a curated playlist.
* [Sopwith Camel N6254 RFC](https://www.aerialvisuals.ca/AirframeDossier.php?Serial=29479),
  which was recently assigned the civil registration code of ZK-SDL. A strange
  coincidence... or a reference to this project? The plane is on display in
  the Vintage Aviation Museum in New Zealand.
