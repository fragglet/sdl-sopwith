SDL Sopwith FAQ
===============

- **Q**: What is this? What is Sopwith?

  **A**: Sopwith is a classic side scrolling shoot 'em up developed in
  the 1980s by the Canadian firm BMB Compuscience. You pilot a *Sopwith
  Camel* biplane, attempting to bomb enemy targets while avoiding enemy
  planes. The original game was for MS-DOS.

  In 2000, Dave L. Clark, the original programmer behind Sopwith,
  released the source code to Sopwith. This is an updated version based
  on his released sources; it is not a rewrite or recreation. It is
  named SDL Sopwith as it makes use of the LibSDL multimedia library to
  access the screen and the sound device.

- **Q**: What is SDL?

  **A**: LibSDL is a multimedia library designed for portability.
  Instead of coding for a particular platform (such as Windows, Linux
  etc.), you use the SDL interface. Your program can then be ported to
  many different platforms with only minor changes. There is more
  information at http://www.libsdl.org/

- **Q**: What platforms does it run on?

  **A**: I have compiled and run it successfully on Windows, Linux,
  macOS, OpenBSD and NetBSD, for a variety of different CPU
  architectures. Others have done ports to AmigaOS, and the Nintendo DS
  and Wii.

  As it uses LibSDL for video and sound, it *ought to* compile "out of
  the box" on any platform supported by SDL. Other platforms supported
  by SDL include Haiku, RISC OS, iOS and Android. If you're able to get
  it running on new platforms, pleas let me know!

- **Q**: This is different to the original Sopwith!

  **A**: If you played one of the original DOS versions of Sopwith, you
  may notice some differences, depending on the version you played:

  - If you played what is known by fans as "Sopwith 1", you might
    remember the ground being drawn as a solid mass instead of . You
    might also notice that there are oxen and flocks of birds which were
    not present in this version. These were added in "Sopwith 2". The
    musical theme was also changed.
  - If you played what is known by fans as "Sopwith 2", you might notice
    that there are new features such as wounded planes and "splats" that
    appear on the screen. These were added in the "Author's Edition"
    release made by Sopwith's original author, Dave Clark.

  In general, SDL Sopwith tries hard to avoid making any large changes
  to the original gameplay. The default settings emulate the behavior
  of "Sopwith 2" but it can be reconfigured to behave like "Sopwith 1"
  if that's what you prefer.

- **Q**: Does it have sound?

  **A**: Yes! Sound is done through an emulation of the PC Speaker
  using the digital output available on modern sound cards.

- **Q**: Does it have multiplayer support?

  **A**: Yes! Classic Sopwith had support for multiplayer as well, but
  it used a proprietary networking system (which Sopwith was made to
  demonstrate). Sopwith 2 also had support for "2 players over an
  asynchronous line", presumably for playing over a serial cable,
  although this did not seem to work either. I have replaced the serial
  code with code to use TCP/IP.  This means that you can play 2 player
  SDL Sopwith over a LAN with TCP/IP or even over the Internet.

- **Q**: How do I play this through a firewall?

  **A**: Most home routers require you to set up port forwarding to
  establish a connection for multiplayer. You'll need to forward TCP
  port 3847.

  Alternatively, if you can run a TCP server that forwards data between
  clients that connect to it, two Sopwith players that connect to this
  server should automatically find each other. It is fairly simple to
  write do this with "netcat". for example:

```shell
  nc -l -p 3847 -c "nc -l -p 3847"
```

- **Q**: What license is this released under?

  **A**: This is released under the GNU General Public License,
  version 2. The Sopwith source was originally released under a more
  restrictive license, but it has since been relicensed.
