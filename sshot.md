SDL Sopwith's use of the SDL library means that it will even run on more
niche OSes such as [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/).

Looks can sometimes be deceptive. This is actually SDL Sopwith running under
NetBSD on a Raspberry Pi. In the screenshot you can see a splatted bird that
has wounded the plane, two optional features that can be turned on.

Multiplayer mode allows you to dogfight with your friends.
