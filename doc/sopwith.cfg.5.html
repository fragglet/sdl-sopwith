<p>.TH sopwith.cfg 5 .SH NAME sopwith.cfg - configuration file for SDL
Sopwith .SH DESCRIPTION .PP \fIsopwith.cfg\fR is the configuration file
for \fBsopwith\fR(6). The settings stored in \fIsopwith.cfg\fR are
usually modified in-game via the options menu. .PP \fIsopwith.cfg\fR is
normally stored in the user's home directory, as \fI~/.local/share/SDL
Sopwith/default.cfg\fR. The path can be overridden using the
\fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fR environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory
Specification). .br .SH FILE FORMAT The file is a plain-text file,
consisting of a list of configuration options and their values,
separated by whitespace. Each option is stored on a separate line. .PP
For example: .RS .PP integer_value 1 .br integer_value2 1 .RE .PP Lines
beginning with "#" are interpreted as comments and will be ignored.
Invalid lines or comments in the file will generate a warning, but will
otherwise be ignored. .PP Some options are used for keyboard key
bindings; these are stored as integer values containing the keyboard
scan code of the key to be bound to. Boolean values are also stored as
integers, with a value of zero usually indicating "false" and a non-zero
value indicating "true".</p>
<p>.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES .TP \fBvid_fullscreen\fR If 1, the game
runs full screen rather than in a window. By default this is 0. .TP
\fBsnd_tinnyfilter\fR If 1, a filter is applied to the sound output so
that it sounds more like a tinny PC speaker that's inside a metal PC
case. By default this is 1. .TP \fBconf_solidground\fR If 1, display the
ground as a solid white block, reproducing the visual appearance of
"Sopwith 1". If 0, the ground is displayed as a line, reproducing the
visual appearance of "Sopwith 2". By default this is 0. .TP
\fBconf_hudsplats\fR If 1, "splats" are shown on the screen when the
plane takes damage: splatted birds are shown on the screen after a bird
strike; windscreen "cracks" are shown if the plane is hit by bullets,
and the whole screen turns magenta after flying through an ox. This
feature was added by the original author of Sopwith in the "Network
Edition" release. By default this is 0. .TP \fBconf_wounded\fR If 1,
planes can take a single unit of damage without crashing. Your plane
becomes slower to turn when wounded. This feature was added by the
original author of Sopwith in the "Network Edition" release. By default
this is 0. .TP \fBconf_animals\fR If 1, oxen and birds appear in the
game. These were added in "Sopwith 2" but were not present in the
original "Sopwith 1". By default this is 1. .TP \fBconf_harrykeys\fR If
1, the \fBkey_pullup\fR and \fBkey_pulldown\fR controls turn your plane
relative to the screen, rather than your plane. It is a common point of
confusion that the direction of turning appears to "reverse" when the
plane is flipped / flying towards the left. By default this is 0. .TP
\fBconf_big_explosions\fR If 1, oil tanks produce a huge explosion when
destroyed. This reproduces the behavior found in both "Sopwith 1" and
"Sopwith 2", but the magnitude of the explosion was dialed back
significantly in the "Network Edition" release. The default is 1. .TP
\fBconf_medals\fR If 1, medals are sometimes awarded to the player on
return to base. Some details can be found in the "MEDALS" section of
\fBsopwith\fR(6). The medals do not have any effect on gameplay. By
default this is 1. .SH KEY BINDINGS The following settings determine the
in-game controls. These are keyboard scancodes, so the key binding does
not change with keyboard layout. However, the name for the key as shown
in the in-game options menu should match the current keyboard layout.
The values for these settings are scancodes from the USB standard for
HID devices: .PP <a
href="https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf">https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf</a>
.TP \fBkey_accelerate\fR Key to accelerate the plane. Default is "X" on
a US layout keyboard. .TP \fBkey_decelerate\fR Key to decelerate the
plane. Decelerating too much may cause the plane to stall. Default is
"Z" on a US layout keyboard. .TP \fBkey_pullup\fR Key to pull up (aim
the plane towards the sky). Default is "," on a US layout keyboard. Note
that \fBconf_harrykeys\fR may change the behavior of this key binding.
.TP \fBkey_pulldown\fR Key to pull down (aim the plane towards the
ground. Default is "/" on a US layout keyboard. Note that
\fBconf_harrykeys\fR may change the behavior of this key binding. .TP
\fBkey_flip\fR Key to flip the plane upside down. Default is "." on a US
layout keyboard. .TP \fBkey_fire\fR Key to fire the machine gun. Default
on a US layout keyboard is the spacebar. .TP \fBkey_dropbomb\fR Key to
drop a bomb. Default is "B" on a US layout keyboard. .TP \fBkey_home\fR
Key to autopilot the plane home to base. Default is "H" on a US layout
keyboard. .SH HIDDEN SETTINGS The following are "hidden settings": they
cannot be edited in-game via the options menu, and editing the
configuration file is the only way to change them. .TP
\fBconf_missiles\fR Enable missiles and starbursts (flares). This is a
feature that was originally added by the author of Sopwith in the
"Network Edition" release, but has been hidden as it significantly
changes the gameplay in a way that doesn't fit the game's theme and also
isn't particularly fun. .TP \fBkey_missile\fR Fire missile, if
\fBconf_missiles\fR is enabled. Default key is "V" on a US layout
keyboard. .TP \fBkey_starburst\fR Launch starburst (flare) if
\fBconf_missiles\fR is enabled. Default key is "C" on a US layout
keyboard. .SH SEE ALSO \fBsopwith\fR(6)</p>
