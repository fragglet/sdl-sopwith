<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>sopwith - classic aerial combat shoot em up game</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>sopwith</strong> [ -n | -s | -c | -l | -j <em>host</em> ]
[-f] [-g<em>level</em>] [-q]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Sopwith is a modern port of the classic 1980s shoot 'em up game of
the same name. The game has a World War I aviation theme. The object of
Sopwith is to destroy all enemy targets with a somewhat limited
airforce. It can be played both in single player and multiplayer mode
over a TCP/IP network. Sopwith looks for a configuration file in the
user's home directory at <em>~/.local/share/SDL
Sopwith/sopwith.cfg</em>; the configuration file is only generated after
the user changes one of the settings from the in-game options menu.
Details about the contents of this file can be found in
<strong>sopwith.cfg</strong>(5).</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt>-n</dt>
<dd>
<p>Start a single player game in novice mode. In novice mode there are
no oxen or birds, you have infinite ammo and bombs, and it is not
possible to stall the plane. This is a good option if you are new to the
game, or if you're just interested in more casual gameplay without so
much of a challenge.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-s</dt>
<dd>
<p>Start a single player in expert mode</p>
</dd>
<dt>-c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Start a single player vs. computer game</p>
</dd>
<dt>-l</dt>
<dd>
<p>Start a network game listening for a network connection. See the
section "MULTIPLAYER SERVERS" below for more details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-j <em>host:port</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Start a network game, connecting to another listening host as
specified by <em>host:port</em>. If the port number is not specified
then TCP port 3847 is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-f</dt>
<dd>
<p>Start in full screen mode if possible.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-g<em>level</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Start the game on the indicated difficulty level. For instance, use
-g2 to start the game on level 2. The default is level 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>-q</dt>
<dd>
<p>Turn off sound (quiet)</p>
</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<h1>TIPS</h1>
<p>The following are some tips for playing the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start off by playing in single player mode before playing against
the computer. This will allow you to "get the feel of the stick" without
being attacked by enemy planes. Practice dropping bombs on ground
targets, as this is a key skill.</p></li>
<li><p>Accelerate to maximum speed on takeoff, otherwise you may stall
the plane. Moving at speed is particularly important when playing
against the computer, as you are otherwise likely to be outmanuevered by
the enemy planes.</p></li>
<li><p>Bombs can be used against planes as well as ground targets. It
can sometimes be easier to hit a plane with a bomb instead of the
machine gun.</p></li>
<li><p>The machine gun can be used to destroy ground targets as well as
planes. Some targets at the edges of the map are much easier to destroy
in this way. Since the machine gun has a limited range, reducing your
speed when attacking a ground target can give you more time to aim and
attack before you have to pull away.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer planes will try to tail you so that they can shoot you
down. Don't allow them to get a clear shot. "Wiggling" the plane by
repeatedly pulling up and down can be an effective evasive
maneuver.</p></li>
<li><p>Firing your machine gun through a flock of birds will cause the
birds to disperse, and the computer planes will sometimes hit a bird and
crash. However, this tactic can also backfire.</p></li>
<li><p>Each computer plane has a "territory" and if you escape that
territory they will break off their pursuit. At the boundary between
territories you can sometimes trick two planes into crashing into each
other.</p></li>
<li><p>When your plane is crashing, the pull up/down keys still have a
small effect on your trajectory. You can use this to try to crash your
plane into a ground target.</p></li>
<li><p>Hitting the top of your screen stalls your plane. Hold down the
pull up key to break out of the stall before your plane crashes into the
ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait until you're close to your base with a clear path to the
runway before pressing the home key - the autopilot sometimes makes
mistakes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>MEDALS</h1>
<p>If the "medals" game option is turned on, the player is rewarded with
ribbons and medals for the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with a single white stripe)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Shooting down 5 planes</p>
</dd>
<dt>Top Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with two white stripes)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Shooting down 25 planes (difficult!)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Service Ribbon (cyan with white edges)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Three successful raids</p>
</dd>
<dt>Perfect Ribbon (white with two magenta stripes)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Finishing a level with no planes lost</p>
</dd>
<dt>Competence Medal (white medal on a cyan ribbon)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Gaining 25 points in a single flight, where 3 points are awarded per
plane and 4 per building</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ribbon of Competence (white with magenta stripe)</dt>
<dd>
<p>As above, a second time</p>
</dd>
<dt>Purple Heart (magenta heart on a cyan ribbon)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Returning to base after having been damaged</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ribbon of Valour (magenta with white stripe)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Gaining a certain number of points for destroyed planes and
buildings; the points depend on whether the player was damaged at that
point in time, and how far away the destroyed object was from the
player's base</p>
</dd>
<dt>Victoria Cross (cyan cross on a magenta ribbon)</dt>
<dd>
<p>As above, but a few more points</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All medals and counters for these are reset once a plane is
destroyed.</p>
<h1>MULTIPLAYER SERVERS</h1>
<p>When run in "listen" mode with the <strong>-l</strong> command line
flag (see above), <strong>sopwith</strong> runs as a server that listens
for an incoming connection. To make this server available from a home
Internet connection, you will typically have to set up a port forward
from your Internet router. The port to forward is TCP port 3847. You
will also need to find out your public IP address so that the other
player can connect. Alternatively, if you have access to a *nix-based
server then it may be preferable to run something like a dedicated
server that avoids the hassle of port forwarding and dynamic IPs. All
that is needed in order to do this is to run a TCP server that forwards
connections between two clients. This can be done using
<strong>nc</strong>(1); for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nc -l -p 3847 -c "nc -l -p 3847"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developing the above command into a complete shell script for a
continually-active dedicated server is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<h1>AUTHORS</h1>
<p>Originally written by David L. Clark for BMB Compuscience<br />
Modern SDL port By Simon Howard, Jesse Smith</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Sopwith was originally developed by BMB Compuscience of Canada as a
demonstration game for their Imaginet Networking System. The system was
not commercially successful but Sopwith became a popular game for the
IBM PC and compatibles. A sequel that is referred to by fans as "Sopwith
2" was actually a newer version rather than a different game, but
included extra features, such as oxen and birds (the oxen being an
in-joke reference to a BMB employee who was nicknamed "Ox").</p>
<p>The original author, David L. Clark, later released "Sopwith - The
Network Edition" with several extra features including comical heads-up
"splats" and wounded planes; a follow-up titled "The Author's Edition"
contained the same features. This version of Sopwith is based on the
released source code to the Network Edition.</p>
<p>The real Sopwith Camel F.1 was one of the most famous fighter planes
of World War I; Camel pilots shot down 1,294 enemy aircraft over the
course of the war, more than any other aircraft. The plane gained a
reputation for being agile but difficult to fly; many novice pilots
crashed the plane on takeoff. The Camel was designed and manufactured by
the Sopwith Aviation Company, founded by aviation pioneer Thomas
Sopwith; 5,490 aircraft were produced. In popular culture the Camel is
known for being the biplane flown by the protagonist in the
<em>Biggles</em> series of novels, and by Snoopy in the <em>Peanuts</em>
comic strip.</p>
