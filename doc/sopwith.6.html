<p>.TH sopwith 6 . .SH NAME sopwith - classic aerial combat shoot em up
game . .SH SYNOPSIS .B sopwith [ -n | -s | -c | -l | -j \fIhost\fR ]
[-f] [-g\fIlevel\fR] [-q] . .SH DESCRIPTION Sopwith is a modern port of
the classic 1980s shoot 'em up game of the same name. The game has a
World War I aviation theme. The object of Sopwith is to destroy all
enemy targets with a somewhat limited airforce. . It can be played both
in single player and multiplayer mode over a TCP/IP network. . Sopwith
looks for a configuration file in the user's home directory at
\fI~/.local/share/SDL Sopwith/sopwith.cfg\fR; the configuration file is
only generated after the user changes one of the settings from the
in-game options menu. Details about the contents of this file can be
found in \fBsopwith.cfg\fR(5). . .SH OPTIONS .TP -n Start a single
player game in novice mode. In novice mode there are no oxen or birds,
you have infinite ammo and bombs, and it is not possible to stall the
plane. This is a good option if you are new to the game, or if you're
just interested in more casual gameplay without so much of a challenge.
.TP -s Start a single player in expert mode .TP -c Start a single player
vs. computer game .TP -l Start a network game listening for a network
connection. See the section "MULTIPLAYER SERVERS" below for more
details. .TP -j \fIhost:port\fR Start a network game, connecting to
another listening host as specified by \fIhost:port\fR. If the port
number is not specified then TCP port 3847 is used. .TP -f Start in full
screen mode if possible. .TP -g\fIlevel\fR Start the game on the
indicated difficulty level. For instance, use -g2 to start the game on
level 2. The default is level 0. .TP -q Turn off sound (quiet) . .SH
CONTROLS The standard controls on a US layout keyboard are as follows:
.TP comma pull up .TP slash pull down .TP period flip plane .TP Z
decrease speed .TP X increase speed .TP space fire machine gun .TP B
drop bomb .TP H autopilot plane to home base .TP S turn on sound effects
.TP Ctrl+C quit .TP Ctrl+C Ctrl+C Ctrl+C quit immediately . .SH TIPS The
following are some tips for playing the game: .IP (bu Start off by
playing in single player mode before playing against the computer. This
will allow you to "get the feel of the stick" without being attacked by
enemy planes. Practice dropping bombs on ground targets, as this is a
key skill. .IP (bu Accelerate to maximum speed on takeoff, otherwise you
may stall the plane. Moving at speed is particularly important when
playing against the computer, as you are otherwise likely to be
outmanuevered by the enemy planes. .IP (bu Bombs can be used against
planes as well as ground targets. It can sometimes be easier to hit a
plane with a bomb instead of the machine gun. .IP (bu The machine gun
can be used to destroy ground targets as well as planes. Some targets at
the edges of the map are much easier to destroy in this way. Since the
machine gun has a limited range, reducing your speed when attacking a
ground target can give you more time to aim and attack before you have
to pull away. .IP (bu Computer planes will try to tail you so that they
can shoot you down. Don't allow them to get a clear shot. "Wiggling" the
plane by repeatedly pulling up and down can be an effective evasive
maneuver. .IP (bu Firing your machine gun through a flock of birds will
cause the birds to disperse, and the computer planes will sometimes hit
a bird and crash. However, this tactic can also backfire. .IP (bu Each
computer plane has a "territory" and if you escape that territory they
will break off their pursuit. At the boundary between territories you
can sometimes trick two planes into crashing into each other. .IP (bu
When your plane is crashing, the pull up/down keys still have a small
effect on your trajectory. You can use this to try to crash your plane
into a ground target. .IP (bu Hitting the top of your screen stalls your
plane. Hold down the pull up key to break out of the stall before your
plane crashes into the ground. .IP (bu Wait until you're close to your
base with a clear path to the runway before pressing the home key - the
autopilot sometimes makes mistakes. . .SH MEDALS . If the "medals" game
option is turned on, the player is rewarded with ribbons and medals for
the following: . .TP Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with a single white stripe)
Shooting down 5 planes .TP Top Flying Ace Ribbon (cyan with two white
stripes) Shooting down 25 planes (difficult!) .TP Service Ribbon (cyan
with white edges) Three successful raids .TP Perfect Ribbon (white with
two magenta stripes) Finishing a level with no planes lost .TP
Competence Medal (white medal on a cyan ribbon) Gaining 25 points in a
single flight, where 3 points are awarded per plane and 4 per building
.TP Ribbon of Competence (white with magenta stripe) As above, a second
time .TP Purple Heart (magenta heart on a cyan ribbon) Returning to base
after having been damaged .TP Ribbon of Valour (magenta with white
stripe) Gaining a certain number of points for destroyed planes and
buildings; the points depend on whether the player was damaged at that
point in time, and how far away the destroyed object was from the
player's base .TP Victoria Cross (cyan cross on a magenta ribbon) As
above, but a few more points .PP All medals and counters for these are
reset once a plane is destroyed. . .SH MULTIPLAYER SERVERS . When run in
"listen" mode with the \fB-l\fR command line flag (see above),
\fBsopwith\fR runs as a server that listens for an incoming connection.
To make this server available from a home Internet connection, you will
typically have to set up a port forward from your Internet router. The
port to forward is TCP port 3847. You will also need to find out your
public IP address so that the other player can connect. . Alternatively,
if you have access to a *nix-based server then it may be preferable to
run something like a dedicated server that avoids the hassle of port
forwarding and dynamic IPs. All that is needed in order to do this is to
run a TCP server that forwards connections between two clients. This can
be done using \fBnc\fR(1); for example: . .RS nc -l -p 3847 -c "nc -l -p
3847" .RE . Developing the above command into a complete shell script
for a continually-active dedicated server is left as an exercise for the
reader. . .SH SEE ALSO \fBsopwith.cfg\fR(5), \fBtriplane\fR(6),
\fBairstrike\fR(6) . .SH AUTHORS Originally written by David L. Clark
for BMB Compuscience .br Modern SDL port By Simon Howard, Jesse Smith .
.SH HISTORY Sopwith was originally developed by BMB Compuscience of
Canada as a demonstration game for their Imaginet Networking System. The
system was not commercially successful but Sopwith became a popular game
for the IBM PC and compatibles. A sequel that is referred to by fans as
"Sopwith 2" was actually a newer version rather than a different game,
but included extra features, such as oxen and birds (the oxen being an
in-joke reference to a BMB employee who was nicknamed "Ox"). .PP The
original author, David L. Clark, later released "Sopwith - The Network
Edition" with several extra features including comical heads-up "splats"
and wounded planes; a follow-up titled "The Author's Edition" contained
the same features. This version of Sopwith is based on the released
source code to the Network Edition. .PP The real Sopwith Camel F.1 was
one of the most famous fighter planes of World War I; Camel pilots shot
down 1,294 enemy aircraft over the course of the war, more than any
other aircraft. The plane gained a reputation for being agile but
difficult to fly; many novice pilots crashed the plane on takeoff. The
Camel was designed and manufactured by the Sopwith Aviation Company,
founded by aviation pioneer Thomas Sopwith; 5,490 aircraft were
produced. In popular culture the Camel is known for being the biplane
flown by the protagonist in the \fIBiggles\fR series of novels, and by
Snoopy in the \fIPeanuts\fR comic strip.</p>
